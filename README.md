# **Zepto Sales Analysis**

## *Business Problem*
Zepto seeks to optimize sales performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and streamline inventory allocation across its retail outlets. The objective is to identify data-driven opportunities for operational and strategic improvement by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), customer ratings, and distribution metrics.

## *Project Overview*
This analysis transforms Zepto’s raw data into well-defined business intelligence outputs. SQL queries extract key metrics including total and average sales, ratings and outlet-level performance that are then visualized in a Power BI dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

## *Tools and Concepts*
•	**SQL & Data Cleaning**: Standardization of categorical fields (Item_Fat_Content) to ensure accuracy in reporting and aggregation.
•	**Data Aggregation**: Use of advanced SQL functions for sums, averages, counts and pivots to produce multifaceted performance reports.
•	**Power BI Dashboard**: Design and implementation of an interactive dashboard visually displaying KPIs, segmentation by outlet/location/size/type, fat content, item type and temporal trends.
•	**Statistical Analysis**: Calculation and visual representation of averages, percentages and ratios to support operational and executive recommendations.

## *Achievements*
•	**Robust Data Model**: Cleaned and structured Zepto retail data for accurate analysis and reporting.
•	**Comprehensive KPI Tracking**: Delivered insights on total sales ($1.20M), average sales ($141), item count (8,523) and customer ratings (3.9/5).
•	**Segmentation**: Evaluated performance by fat content, item type, outlet size, establishment year, location and type, leveraging both tabular and visual analytics.
•	**Dashboard Creation**: Built a Power BI dashboard that enables quick, intuitive exploration of sales, ratings and distribution metrics, supporting business strategy conversations and daily operations.

## *Business Insights*
•	**Sales Concentration**: ‘Regular’ fat products outperform ‘Low Fat’ in total sales ($776K vs. $423K).
•	**Growth Opportunities**: Fruits, snacks, and household items drive most sales among item types, highlighting potential promotion and stock optimization strategies.
•	**Outlet Strategy**: Medium outlets contribute 42.27% of total sales, and Tier 3 locations generate the highest revenue, indicating focus areas for expansion and marketing.
•	**Customer Satisfaction**: Supermarket Type 1 records the highest sales and item count; customer ratings are consistent across outlet types but may be further optimized alongside visibility metrics.
•	**Temporal Trends**: Outlets established in 2018 saw a peak in sales ($205K), with stability observed in subsequent years.
